# CodeInsight - Python Code Summarization for VS Code

CodeInsight is a powerful tool designed for Python developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It enables you to generate concise and insightful code summaries for Python functions and methods, right within your favorite code editor.

## Features

- **Automated Code Summarization:** Leverage the Langchain Large Language Model (LLM) framework to generate clear and concise code summaries (WIP). Currently a CLI application is being build to provide this feature. 
- **Seamless VS Code Integration:** The CodeInsight extension seamlessly integrates into your VS Code environment, providing quick access to code summaries (TODO).
- **User-Friendly UI:** Intuitive user interface elements make it easy to access and understand code summaries (TODO).
- **Developer-Focused:** Tailored for Python developers working within the VS Code ecosystem (WIP).

## Getting Started

Currently, the only way to obtain this software is to manually install it from github. 
This is a work in progress and there are not releases so far. 

To start using CodeInsight's code summarization feature, follow these steps:

1. Checkout the repository `git clone https://github.com/sajomathews/codeinsight.git`
2. Install the project using poetry `poetry install`
3. Run the CLI `poetry run codeinsight --help`
